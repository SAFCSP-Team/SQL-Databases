# Table Management
A table is the main structure used to store data in a relational database. It organizes information into rows (records) and columns (fields). When creating a table, you decide which columns you need (the data you want to store) and the data types for each column.

The data types available for MySQL databases include:

**Numeric Types**
- `INT` – whole numbers  
- `BIGINT` – large whole numbers  
- `DECIMAL(m, d)` – exact numbers with decimals  
- `FLOAT` / `DOUBLE` – approximate decimal values  

**String Types**
- `VARCHAR(n)` – variable‑length text  
- `CHAR(n)` – fixed‑length text  
- `TEXT` – long text  
- `ENUM` – a list of allowed values  

**Date and Time Types**
- `DATE` – calendar date  
- `TIME` – time of day  
- `DATETIME` – date and time  
- `TIMESTAMP` – date and time with automatic updates  

**Boolean**
- `BOOLEAN` – true/false values

An example of a table is `Students`, where each student has the following columns. 

| Column Name | Data Type     |
|-------------|---------------|
| id          | INT           |
| name        | VARCHAR(50)   |
| age         | INT           |
| gpa         | DECIMAL(3,2)  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended to have a primary key for each table to uniquely identify each record. For example, to uniquely identify each student, there must be a student ID set as the primary key.


## Create a Table
To create a table, you must be in the correct database. If the database does not exist yet, create it using the `CREATE DATABASE School` command, 
and then switch into it using the `USE School` command before creating any tables.

After that, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` command to create your table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name data_type,
    column_name data_type,
    ...
);
```

**Example**

The following command creates a Students table with four columns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    gpa DECIMAL(3,2)
);

```

If you want to have the `id` as a primary key, use:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    gpa DECIMAL(3,2)
);

```

## Display Tables
To display all tables inside the currently selected database, use:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

## Delete a Table
To permanently remove a table and all its data, use:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

**Example**

```sql
DROP TABLE Students;
```
