# Record Management
Records (rows) are the actual data stored inside a table. Each record represents one complete entry and contains values for every column defined in the table structure. 
While a table defines what kind of data can be stored, the records represent the **actual information** being stored.

For example, the Students table can have the following records:
| id | name    | age | gpa  |
|----|---------|-----|------|
| 1  | Rana    | 21  | 3.50 |
| 2  | Nouf    | 20  | 2.75 |
| 3  | Sara    | 22  | 3.10  | 
| 4  | Maha    | 19  | 3.80  |

Each record has a value for each column that matches the data type specified when the table was created.


## Create a Record
To add a new record (row) into a table, you can use the `INSERT INTO` command. 
> A record must follow the same structure as the table, meaning each value must match the data type of its corresponding column.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

### Add a Single Record 

```sql
INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age, gpa)
VALUES (1, 'Rana', 21, 3.50);
```

Insert another record
```sql
INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age, gpa)
VALUES (2, 'Nouf', 20, 2.75);
```

### Add Multiple Records 

```sql
INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age, gpa)
VALUES
(3, 'Sara', 22, 3.10),
(4, 'Maha', 19, 3.80);
```


## Read Records
To view the data stored inside a table, you use the `SELECT` command. This command allows you to retrieve specific columns, filter results, or display all records in the table.

### Select All Records
Print all the data in a table.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

### Select Specific Columns
Retrieve only certain columns from the table.
```sql
SELECT name, gpa FROM Students;
```

### Filter Records 
To filter the records and select data based on a condition, you can use the `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE age > 20;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE id = 2;
```
## Update Records 
To modify existing records in a table, you use the `UPDATE` command.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is important to use the `WHERE` clause when updating records. Without it, **all rows in the table will be updated**.

### Update One Record

**Update a single column**

Update the `gpa` of the student with `id = 1`:
```sql
UPDATE Students
SET gpa = 3.90
WHERE id = 1;
```
Rana now has a `gpa` of 3.90.

**Update multiple columns**
```sql
UPDATE Students
SET age = 20, gpa = 3.89
WHERE id = 4;
```

## Delete Records
To remove records from a table, you use the `DELETE` command. This command permanently removes rows, 
so it should be used carefully. Always use the `WHERE` clause to make sure you only delete the intended records.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is important to use the `WHERE` clause. Without it, **all records in the table will be deleted**.

### Delete One Record
Delete the student with `id = 3`:

```sql
DELETE FROM Students
WHERE id = 3;
```

## Practice
Use the `Students` table below to practice creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

| id | name  | age | gpa  |
|----|-------|-----|------|
| 1  | Amal  | 22  | 3.40 |
| 2  | Faisal| 19  | 2.90 |

Follow the steps below:
1. Insert two new students into the table:
   - (3, Sara, 20, 3.60)
   - (4, Omar, 21, 2.80)

2. Display all records from the `Students` table.

3. Display only the `name` and `gpa` columns.

4. Select all students who have a `gpa` greater than **3.00**.

5. Update the `age` of the student with `id = 2` to **20**.

6. Update the `gpa` of the student with `id = 1` to **3.75**.

7. Delete the student with `id = 4`.
