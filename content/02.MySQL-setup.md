# MySQL Setup
For the implementation of SQL databases, we will be using **MySQL**, which is a popular open‑source RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that allows us to create and manage relational databases.

## Installation
Before installing MySQL, it’s important to understand the difference between a **database server** and an **IDE**.  
MySQL Server is the actual database engine responsible for storing data, processing queries, and managing databases.  
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment), on the other hand, is a tool that helps you interact with the server more easily by providing features like a graphical interface, text editors, and query tools.

To install MySQL, you can visit the [MySQL Community Downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) to explore all available community tools, 
or go directly to the [MySQL Community Server download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and choose the version that matches your operating system.

### Steps
1. Click the download link that matches your operating system in [MySQL Community Server download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
2. Follow the installation steps.
3. After installation, try running `mysql -u root -p`. If the command is not recognized, follow the troubleshooting steps below.

> [!NOTE]
> The download process is the same for Windows and macOS, but each operating system uses a different installer.

## Choosing a MySQL Client 
Once MySQL Server is installed, you need a way to interact with it. You can either use the MySQL Command-Line Client (as shown in Step 3 above) or an IDE such as MySQL Workbench.


### Using the MySQL Command-Line Client
MySQL includes a built‑in terminal client that allows you to run SQL queries directly from your command line. 
To open it, run: 
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

#### Fixing MacOS Command Not Found Issue
If you encounter `zsh: command not found: mysql` on your **MacOS** device, then follow the steps below, 
1. Check if mysql is installed using the `ls /usr/local/mysql/bin` command. If there are files such as mysql, mysqld, mysqladmin, then MySQL is installed and the issue is linking the path.
2. Add mysql to your system PATH using the `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc` command.
3. Reload the terminal.
4. Now the `mysql -u root -p` command should work.

#### Fixing “mysql is not recognized” on Windows
1. Open the Start Menu and search for **Environment Variables**.
2. Click **Edit the system environment variables**.
3. In the window that appears, click **Environment Variables…**.
4. Under **System variables**, select **Path** and click **Edit**.
5. Click **New** and add the MySQL bin folder path, for example:  
   `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin`
6. Save and close all windows.
7. Restart your Command Prompt or PowerShell.
8. Now the `mysql -u root -p` command should work.



### Using a Graphical Interface (IDE)
If you prefer a visual environment, you can install **MySQL Workbench**, an official GUI tool provided by MySQL. 
Workbench allows you to: 
- Connect to your MySQL Server
- Write and execute SQL queries
- View and edit tables
- Manage users and permissions
- Design database schemas visually

You can download it from the [MySQL Workbench download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
