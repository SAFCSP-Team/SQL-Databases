# Introduction to Databases

A database is a system used to store and organize data in a structured way to make searching, managing, and retrieving information easier.
Different databases organize data differently: some use tables with rows and columns, which are known as SQL or relational databases, while others store data as documents grouped into collections, which are known as NoSQL or non‑relational databases.

> [!NOTE]
> Document‑based databases are just *one* type of NoSQL database.
> Other NoSQL types include key–value stores, column‑family stores, and graph databases.



## SQL Databases
SQL databases are widely used systems that store and manage data using a structured, table‑based model. They rely on **SQL (Structured Query Language)** for interacting with the data. SQL databases organize information in tables, where each table represents a specific entity, such as Students or Books, and the relationships between these tables help maintain organized and consistent data.

### Examples of SQL Databases
- MySQL 
- PostgreSQL 
- SQLite 
- Microsoft SQL Server 
- Oracle Database

> [!NOTE]
> A DBMS (Database Management System) is any system designed to store, manage, and organize databases. Therefore, the SQL databases listed above—such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and Oracle—are all examples of DBMSs.


### Terminologies 
- **Table**
  
  A way of structuring data as rows and columns.
  
- **Column**
  
  A column defines a specific field in a table and specifies the data type associated with that field.
  
- **Row/Record**
  
  A record is a single entry in the table.
  
- **Schema**
  
  You can think of it as a blueprint of the database; it defines tables, columns, data types, and the relationships between the tables.

For example, `Students` is a **table** with **columns** such as `id`, `name`, `age`, `gpa`, and any other data you want to store. The **row** defines a single student in the database, such as Sami, in the following database table.

| id | name | age |  gpa  |
| ----|-------|----|------|
| 011	| fahad	| 21 | 3.74 |
| 012	| sami	| 20 | 4.00 |
| 013 | khalid| 20 | 4.30 |


### SQL Command Types
SQL is a language used to interact with a database, and its commands are grouped into several categories. The most commonly used categories are as follows.

| Language Category | Purpose | Examples |
| ------------------|---------|----------|
| DDL	(Data Definition Language)	| Defines database structure such as creating tables	| CREATE, ALTER, DROP| 
| DML	(Data Manipulation Language)	| Manages data (records)	| SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| DCL	(Data Control Language)	| Controls permissions	| GRANT, REVOKE |


## Practice 
- On a blank sheet of paper, design a table named `Books`. Add all the columns you think are necessary to store book information, and include a few example rows of data.
