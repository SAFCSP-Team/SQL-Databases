# Database Management
Database management commands are used to create, configure, select, and remove databases within a MySQL server. 
These commands form the foundation of working with SQL because every table, record, and operation **must** exist inside a database. 

## Log into MySQL Server Command Line
To enter the MySQL Command Line and start interacting with the MySQL server, use the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
After entering your password, the command line will start. 


## Display Databases
Lists every database available on the MySQL server.

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```


## Create a Database
Creates a new database with the specified name.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

**Example**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Students;
```

**Output**
```text
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.018 sec)
```
Now, if you display the databases, you will see the `Students` database listed. 

## Use a Database 
Switches the active database so all commands apply to it.

```sql
USE database_name;
```

**Example**

```sql
USE Students;
```

**Output**
```text
Database changed
```

> [!TIP]
> To display the current database, use the `SELECT DATABASE();` command.

## Delete a Database
Permanently delete a database and all its tables.

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

**Example**

```sql
DROP DATABASE Students;
```

**Output**
```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.030 sec)
```
Now, the `Students` database is deleted.

## Exit MySQL Command Line
To exit the MySQL command line, type `exit` in the terminal.

```sql
exit
```
