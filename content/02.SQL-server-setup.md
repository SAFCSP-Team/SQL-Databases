# Microsoft SQL Server Setup
For the implementation of SQL databases, we will be using MS SQL Server, which is an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that allows us to create and manage relational databases.


## Installation 
Before installing MS SQL Server, it’s important to understand the difference between a database server and an IDE. SQL Server is the database engine responsible for storing data, processing queries, and managing databases. 
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment), on the other hand, is a software tool that helps you interact with the server more easily by providing features like a graphical interface, text editors, and query tools.

Now, to install MS SQL Server, you can visit the [SQL Server download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and choose your operating system.

### Windows

#### Steps
1. [Download SQL Server Express (the free edition of SQL Server)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
2. [Download SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), which is an IDE to help manage and visualize databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/install/install).

### macOS
SQL Server does not run natively on macOS. To use it, you must install Docker and run SQL Server inside a container.


#### Steps 
1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. [Install Azure Data Studio, which is an IDE]([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall)).


3. Pull and run SQL Server container from Docker.
