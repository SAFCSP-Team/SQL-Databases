# Views 
A **view** is a virtual table created from a `SELECT` statement. It does not store data by itself — instead, it displays data that comes from one or more existing tables.

This is the table that we will be working on, which is the `Students` table.
| id | name |  age | gpa  |
|----|------|------|------|
|  1 | Rana |   21 | 3.90 |
|  2 | Nouf |   20 | 2.75 |
|  4 | Maha |   20 | 3.89 |

## Create a View 
To create a view, use the `CREATE VIEW` command followed by a `SELECT` statement. 

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example**
Create a view that only shows students from the `Students` table who have a `gpa` above `3.00`.

```sql
CREATE VIEW HighGPAStudents AS
SELECT name, gpa
FROM Students
WHERE gpa > 3.00;
```

Now, you can retrieve the `HighGPAStudents` view data by treating the view as a table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM HighGPAStudents;
```

**Output**

| name | gpa  |
|------|------|
| Rana | 3.90 |
| Maha | 3.89 |


## Update a View
To update a view, you can use the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` command. This means, if the view does not exist, create it; if it already exists, replace it.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example**
Update the view to also include the `age` column.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW HighGPAStudents AS
SELECT name, age, gpa
FROM Students
WHERE gpa > 3.00;
```

now, display the view data using the select command.

```sql
SELECT * FROM HighGPAStudents;
```

**Output**

| name | age | gpa  |
|------|-----|------|
| Rana | 21  | 3.90 |
| Maha | 20  | 3.89 |

## Delete a View
To delete a view, you can use the `DROP VIEW` command.

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Example**

```sql
DROP VIEW HighGPAStudents;
```
Now, if you try to run the `SELECT * FROM HighGPAStudents;` command, this message will appear
```sql
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'school.highgpastudents' doesn't exist
```
Note that this command only **removes the view**, but **does not delete any data** from the underlying table.

## Practice
Use the `Students` table below to practice managing views.

| id | name  | age | gpa  |
|----|-------|-----|------|
| 1  | Rana  | 21  | 3.90 |
| 2  | Nouf  | 20  | 2.75 |
| 3  | Sara  | 22  | 3.10 |
| 4  | Maha  | 19  | 3.89 |

Follow the steps below:

1. Create a view named `TopStudents` that shows only students with a GPA greater than **3.50**.

2. Select all records from the `TopStudents` view.

3. Update the `TopStudents` view so it also includes the `age` column and only shows students with a GPA of **3.80 or higher**.

4. Select all records from the updated `TopStudents` view.

5. Delete the `TopStudents` view.

6. Try selecting from `TopStudents` again and observe what happens.
